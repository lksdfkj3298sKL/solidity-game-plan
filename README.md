I'm completely new to crypto development. After having done a bunch of research about the space, I decided that Ethereum development is the right first-step because of the robust ecosystem & because it's proven. I also digged into Polkadot and that seems legit. Other chains like Solana and Avalanche seem interesting but from an innovation standpoint they don't have anything interesting to offer other than the obvious (ie less gas fees + faster transactions). Polkadot seems much more interesting. Future is multi-chains for sure. Bridges and etc will enable an efficient multi-chain world. There won't be an Eth or any other killer. Less than 2% of the world population use crypto. Barely any crypto devs. Things are still new, but Eth is catching up.

Best use of my time is to learn Ethereum (solidity) dev only. A little bit of FE too y not. Here's my game-plan:

- Follow [this](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/)
- Spend **4 hours a day** coding and going through other peoples' codebases
- Don't spend time degenning. HODL whatever I have. Discord/Twitter/etc is mostly waste of time atm. Use Stackoverflow for questions, and sure use Twitter to get updates on what's happening.

Goal is to be able to code 'anything' (esp defi) with confidence in **3 months from now**.

Start: 1/11/2022
End: 4/11/2022

After learning enough basics, start contributing. Apply for grants, submit PRs, and do whatever. Update this doc to update goal.

### Logs
1/11/2022: Locked in game-plan. Time to get coding. Setup [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) complete. Finished [mapping](https://solidity-by-example.org/).
